                                <p class="judul2 lore">She uses her Radiant powers to animate wooden figures which she calls her pack. The pack is her company, as she usually works alone. It consists of the wooden trinkets or totems as referred to in the game files: a hawk (more specifically, a brown goshawk), a Tasmanian tiger, and three creatures similar to jellyfishes. She also has a totem for her healing ability in the shape of four plants. Sasha has tried to create more complex animated animals, namely a dragon, which didn't turn out well. </p>

                                <p class="judul2 lore">Sasha has a strong connection with plants and animals demonstrated through her trinkets and the drawings on her suit. This has earned her the title of eco-warrior and shaped her antagonistic view towards the Kingdom Corporation and their invasion of natural spaces. </p>
                                    <br>

                                <p class="judul2 lore">Sasha joined the LAFORANT Protocol after Sage invites her in. A Rift had appeared in the forest outside an unknown Kingdom facility in Australia. Sasha told Sage that she plans to stay and protect her land, but after a mention to many more Rifts all over the world, she accepted Sage's offer to become part of the LAFORANT Protocol. Once inside the Protocol, some of the agents believe that she has not developed her powers to their full potential.</p>

                            <div class="box">
                                <p class="judul2 lore">Spye, also known by his real name, Aamir, is a Moroccan tech user with a dark and mysterious past. He has no ties to anyone and seems to have lost his family in the past. Spye has a quirky sense of humor but is always watching the enemy.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="judul2 lore">Although he is a dangerous and dark person, Spye makes jokes and lightens up the atmosphere in the team. Many of his voice lines involve playing around with the rest of the LAFORANT Protocol, however Spye can also be much more morbid, referring to the enemy team in a dark manner. Spye also makes references to gambling, implying that he may have a history related to casinos. Spye's most sensitive aspect is when it comes to his late wife, Nora. He mentions also his family as a whole, and implies that he lost all or most of his family.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="judul2 lore">Spye uses information from his camera and Trapwires to take over the arena. Spye uses his self-made Spycam to tag enemies and reveal their locations, along with Spye-Cages to influence enemy movement. He uses tripwires to catch foes off guard, revealing their location and concussing them. Spye also has a hat which is more than it seems. When thrown at a corpse, it turns into a spider-like robot which reveals the locations of all living enemies around the map. Spye made his whole kit from the tripwires to his special hat.</p>
                                    <br>
                                <p class="judul2 lore">Spye does not have proper relations with anyone, but he has a negative view towards Kingdom, as he thinks they take away the culture from places and tell lies about their practices. This may be because of their unethical and immoral practices, but Kingdom may have played a larger role in his past, possibly to do with his family.</p>
